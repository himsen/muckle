# SIDH v3.0 (C Edition)

The **SIDH** library is an efficient supersingular isogeny-based cryptography library written in C language.
**Version v3.0** of the library includes the ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange scheme "SIDH" [1,2], and the CCA-secure
key encapsulation mechanism "SIKE" [4]. These schemes are conjectured to be secure against quantum computer attacks.

Concretely, the SIDH library includes the following KEM schemes:

* SIKEp503: matching the post-quantum security of AES128.
* SIKEp751: matching the post-quantum security of AES192.

And the following ephemeral key exchange schemes:

* SIDHp503: matching the post-quantum security of AES128.
* SIDHp751: matching the post-quantum security of AES192.

The library was developed by [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/) for experimentation purposes.

## Main Features

- Supports IND-CCA secure key encapsulation mechanism.
- Supports ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
- Supports two security levels matching the post-quantum security of AES128 and AES192.
- Supports a peace-of-mind hybrid key exchange mode that adds a classical elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman 
  key exchange on a high-security Montgomery curve providing 384 bits of classical ECDH security.
- Protected against timing and cache-timing attacks through regular, constant-time implementation of 
  all operations on secret key material.
- Support for Windows OS using Microsoft Visual Studio and Linux OS using GNU GCC and clang.     
- Provides basic implementation of the underlying arithmetic functions using portable C to enable support
  on a wide range of platforms including x64, x86 and ARM . 
- Provides optimized implementations of the underlying arithmetic functions for x64 platforms with optional, 
  high-performance x64 assembly for Linux. 
- Provides an optimized implementation of the underlying arithmetic functions for 64-bit ARM platforms using 
  assembly for Linux.
- Includes Known Answer Tests (KATs), and testing/benchmarking code.

## New in Version 3.0

- Added support for SIKE [4], an IND-CCA secure key encapsulation protocol based on supersingular isogenies.
- Added a new parameter set over the prime p503 that matches the post-quantum security of AES128.
- The implementations are significantly more compact and faster. Among other optimizations, the library exploits a new tripling formula from [5] and the fast three-point ladder algorithm from [6].  
- Removed the code implementing public key compression [3]. 
The old compression code can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/PQCrypto-SIDH/tree/v2.0).
Note that a faster compression implementation [7] is available in a [fork of SIDH](https://github.com/Microsoft/PQCrypto-SIDH/tree/v2.0). 
In this case, public keys are reduced from 564 to 330 bytes, but the computing time suffers almost a two-fold slowdown.
- Added Known Answer Tests (KATs).

## Supported Platforms

**SIDH v3.0** is supported on a wide range of platforms including x64, x86 and ARM devices running Windows 
or Linux OS. We have tested the library with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, GNU GCC v5.4, and clang v3.8.
See instructions below to choose an implementation option and compile on one of the supported platforms.

## Implementation Options

 The following implementation options are available:
- Portable implementations enabled by setting `OPT_LEVEL=GENERIC`. 
- Optimized x64 assembly implementations for Linux enabled by setting `ARCH=x64` and `OPT_LEVEL=FAST`.
- Optimized ARMv8 assembly implementation for Linux enabled by setting `ARCH=ARM64` and `OPT_LEVEL=FAST`.

Follow the instructions in the sections "_Instructions for Linux_" or "_Instructions for Windows_" below to configure these different implementation options.

## Instructions for Linux

By simply executing:

```sh
$ make
```

the library is compiled for x64 using clang, optimization level `FAST`, and using the special instructions MULX
and ADX. Optimization level `FAST` enables the use of assembly, which in turn is a requirement to enable the 
optimizations using MULX/ADX.

Other options for x64:

```sh
$ make ARCH=x64 CC=[gcc/clang] OPT_LEVEL=[FAST/GENERIC] USE_MULX=[TRUE/FALSE] USE_ADX=[TRUE/FALSE] SET=[EXTENDED]
```

Setting `SET=EXTENDED` adds the flags `-fwrapv -fomit-frame-pointer -march=native`. When `OPT_LEVEL=FAST` (i.e., 
assembly use enabled), the user is responsible for setting the flags MULX and ADX according to the targeted 
platform (for example, MULX/ADX are not supported on Sandy or Ivy Bridge, only MULX is supported on Haswell, 
and both MULX and ADX are supported on Broadwell, Skylake and Kaby Lake architectures). Note that USE_ADX can 
only be set to `TRUE` if `USE_MULX=TRUE`.

Options for x86/ARM:

```sh
$ make ARCH=[x86/ARM] CC=[gcc/clang] SET=[EXTENDED]
```

Options for ARM64:

```sh
$ make ARCH=[ARM64] CC=[gcc/clang] OPT_LEVEL=[FAST/GENERIC] SET=[EXTENDED]
```

As in the x64 case, `OPT_LEVEL=FAST` enables the use of assembly optimizations on ARMv8 platforms.

Different tests and benchmarking results are obtained by running:

```sh
$ ./arith_tests-p503
$ ./arith_tests-p751
$ ./sike503/test_SIKE
$ ./sike751/test_SIKE
$ ./sidh503/test_SIDH
$ ./sidh751/test_SIDH
```

To run the KEM implementations against the KATs, execute:

```sh
$ ./sike503/PQCtestKAT_kem
$ ./sike751/PQCtestKAT_kem
```

The program tries its best at auto-correcting unsupported configurations. For example, since the `FAST` implementation is currently only available for x64 and ARMv8 doing `make ARCH=x86 OPT_LEVEL=FAST` is actually processed using `ARCH=x86 OPT_LEVEL=GENERIC`.

## Instructions for Windows

### Building the library with Visual Studio:

Open the solution file [`SIDH.sln`](Visual%20Studio/SIDH/SIDH.sln) in Visual Studio, choose either x64 or Win32 from the platform menu and then choose either `Fast` or `Generic` from the configuration menu (as explained above, the option `Fast` is not currently available for x86). Finally, select "Build Solution" from the "Build" menu. 

### Running the tests:

After building the solution file, there should be 6 executable files: `arith_tests-P503.exe` and `arith_tests-P751.exe`, to run tests for the underlying arithmetic, `test-SIDHp503.exe` and `test-SIDHp751.exe`, to run tests for the key exchange, and `test-SIKEp503.exe` and `test-SIKEp751.exe`, to run tests for the KEM. 

### Using the library:

After building the solution file, add the generated `P503.lib` and `P751.lib` library files to the set of References for a project, and add [`P503_api.h`](src/P503/P503_api.h) and [`P751_api.h`](src/P751/P751_api.h) to the list of header files of a project.
